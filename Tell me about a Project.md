## Title: Building a Full-Stack Website with Java, React, and Spring Boot


Hi! My name is Ihtheram Chowdhury, and I'm excited to share my experience working on a full-stack website project with a team of four. Right now, I'll walk you through the architecture, technologies used, challenges faced, and future enhancements.

---

**1. Project Overview:**
- Our project aimed to create a comprehensive platform for a car rental website.
- We built a full-stack application using Java, React, TypeScript, Spring Boot, and PostgreSQL.

---

**2. Architecture:**
- Let's dive into the architecture:
  - The back end is powered by Spring Boot, which provides REST APIs.
  - Spring Data JPA interacts with our PostgreSQL database.
  - Spring Session is used for user authentication
  - On the front end, we used React to make it a single-page application, React Router for routing to different components, Axios for react components to communicate with the back end via HTTP requests, and for styling we used vanilla CSS.

---

**3. Key Features:**
- Our website includes features like:
  - CRUD operations for admins to manage data on vehicles and locations.
  - CRUD operations for customers to place and cancel orders, pick up, and return vehicles.
  - Authentication and authorization for secure access.

---

**4. Technologies Used:**
- Let's discuss the technologies we used:
  - **Java** which powered our back-end server
  - **React**, which is our front-end framework
  - **TypeScript** to ensure type safety and better tooling in React
  - **Spring Boot** which Simplified the REST API development
  - **Spring Data JPA** which handled database interactions
  - **Spring Web** Managed REST requests.
  - **Git & GitHub** used as version control for our team's collaboration and
  - **PostgreSQL** was our chosen database.

---

**5. Challenges and Solutions:**
- Let's talk about the challenges we faced:
  - During development, we faced challenges mostly with the front end. Because this was our first time implementing React, we were focused more on implementing than planning and early communication, which led to conflicting designs for layout and implementation
  - To overcome this situation, we started communicating more and performed better teamwork.

---

**6. Testing and Deployment:**
- We rigorously tested our application using methods of JUnit and Mockito, which GitHub Copilot generated.

---

**8. Future Enhancements Goal:**
- Looking ahead, we plan to add constraints to admin account creation, and functionality to add images for vehicles.

---

**Conclusion:**
- In summary, our full-stack website project demonstrates the power of Java, React, and Spring Boot.
- That was all about our project, Thank you for listening!
